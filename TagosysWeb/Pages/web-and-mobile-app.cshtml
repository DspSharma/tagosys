                        </h2>
                        <p> Hybrid apps are part native apps, part web apps. (Because of that,
                            many people incorrectly call them “web apps”). Like native apps, they live in an app store
                            and can take advantage of the many device features available. Like web apps, they rely on
                            HTML being rendered in a browser, with the caveat that the browser is embedded within the
                            app. Often, companies build hybrid apps as wrappers for an existing web page; in that way,
                            they hope to get a presence in the app store, without spending significant effort for
                            developing a different app. Hybrid apps are also popular because they allow crossplatform
                            development and thus significantly reduce development costs: that is, the same HTML code
                            components can be reused on different mobile operating systems. Tools such as PhoneGap and
                            Sencha Touch allow people to design and code across platforms, using the power of HTML.</p>

                        </h2>
                        <p> Native apps live on the device and are accessed through icons on the
                            device home screen. Native apps are installed through an application store (such as Google
                            Play or Apple’s App Store). They are developed specifically for one platform, and can take
                            full advantage of all the device features — they can use the camera, the GPS, the
                            accelerometer, the compass, the list of contacts, and so on. They can also incorporate
                            gestures (either standard operating-system gestures or new, app-defined gestures). And
                            native apps can use the device’s notification system and can work offline.</p>

                        <p> Web apps are not real applications; they are really websites that, in
                            many ways, look and feel like native applications, but are not implemented as such. They are
                            run by a browser and typically written in HTML5. Users first access them as they would
                            access any web page: they navigate to a special URL and then have the option of “installing”
                            them on their home screen by creating a bookmark to that page.</p>

                        <p> Mobile applications are first tested within the development
                            environment using emulators and later subjected to field testing. Emulators provide an
                            inexpensive way to test applications on mobile phones to which developers may not have
                            physical access. The following are examples of tools used for testing application across the
                            most popular mobile operating systems. </p>
